    "Descriptive statistics are used to provide a clear and concise summary of the data, enabling researchers to understand its central tendencies, variability, and distribution.\n",

    "They extend the findings from the sample to the larger population, allowing researchers to draw conclusions beyond the immediate data.\n",
    "Inferential statistics rely on probability theory and hypothesis testing to assess the likelihood of observed differences or relationships occurring by chance.\n",
    "Example: Conducting a hypothesis test to determine whether there is a significant difference in exam scores between two groups of students (e.g., those who received tutoring vs. those who did not).\n",
    "How they are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics are used to make predictions, test hypotheses, and draw conclusions about populations based on sample data.\n",
    "They help researchers assess the significance of relationships, differences, or effects observed in the sample, providing insights into broader phenomena or trends.\n",
    "Inferential statistics play a crucial role in scientific research, decision-making, and policy formulation by enabling researchers to make informed judgments and recommendations based on empirical evidence.\"\"\""
